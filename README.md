# NOAA-Lightning-Strikes-Visual-Analysis
I utilize Tableau to visually analyze NOAA Lightning Strikes Data.

The following repository only includes the Tableau Public link on a text file.

The files I used for analysis are too large to upload to GitHub, even in a compressed zip file.

So, you'll just have to take my word for it I guess. 

The datasets I used are publicly available & published by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.
